## Challenges and Learning experiences:

-   Utilizing GitHub branch and merging options for the first time was certainly a challenge. However, good coordination and communication resulted in reduced merging conflicts.
-   The group agrees that we could have dedicated more time wire-framing the app instead of jumping right into it. This might have had resulted in a more optimal UI/UX design.
-   We share our excitement about the opportunity to read, understand, and build on other developer’s code. Albeit the challenges this represents, it provided a unique opportunity to think about the importance of writing well organized code.
